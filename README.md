☺️ Hi, I’m Ryan Valentine, currently residing in Sunny, Salt Lake City 🏔️:relaxed:
🏃 I’m currently pursuing my love for creating tech products as a Software Engineer. 
👨‍🎓 Self-taught in most areas but have been in the surrounding industry for 10+ years. 
⏮️ Most recently, I was a Product manager/sysAdmin/DevOps for my own Software Dev Agency. 
🖥️ I'm an avid Self-hoster and Home automater with ESXI, OMV, Arduinos, and Home Assistant. My homelab server is a HP proliant ML350 gen9
🍎 Fully stocked in the Apple Eco-system, but I have an Android-Pixel4, which was previously used for testing, but now strictly used as drawer decoration 🙃 
👍 👍 👉   🚴 🛠️ ⛳ 🏂 🛫 🌏 💻 🎧
