☺️ Hi, I’m Ryan Valentine, currently residing in Sunny, Salt Lake City 🏔️:relaxed:

🏃 I’m currently pursuing my love for creating tech products as a Software Engineer.

👨‍🎓 Self-taught in most areas but have been in the surrounding industry for 10+ years.

⏮️ Most recently, I was a Software Engineer/Technical Product Manager in my own Software Dev Agency. 🎩 👒 🎩

🖥️ I'm an avid self-hoster and home automater with ESXI, OMV, Arduinos, and Home Assistant. My homelab server is a HP Proliant ML350 gen9.

🍎 Fully stocked in the Apple Eco-system, for better or worse, but I have an Android-Pixel4, which was previously used for testing, but now strictly used as a drawer decoration 🙃

👍 👍 👉 🚴 🛠️ ⛳ 🏂 🛫 🌏 💻 🎧

## Online courses I have comepleted and reccommend (Free and Paid)

[React - The Complete Guide incl Hooks, React Router, Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

- Great updated course by a wonderful teacher where you can learn everything you need for ReactJS including Hooks, Redux, React Routing, and Next.js

[Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos

- Free course that has so many good projects to really learn a wide range of Javascript topics

[Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) by Wes Bos

- A paid course that has been recently updated and includes some great new features of ReactJS and NextJs. Worth every penny

[Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) by Stephen Grider

- Loved this course, very detailed on how things are working in React. Really helped me understand topics that I used but didn't really grasp.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

- Loads of free interactive courses but I reccomend the pro version if you like it. Starting out it made learning alot easier with the integrated code editor and the hand holding that codecademy provided. You do not need to worry about dependecies and envrionment setup right away, plus it gives you feedback right away if a mistake was made.
